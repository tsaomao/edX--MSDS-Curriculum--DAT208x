Further Readings for Chapter 1. Python Basics:
To learn more about Python's recent developments, you can visit www.python.org (https://www.python.org/); the official home page of the Python programming language. Here, you will find guidelines to get started with Python on your own system. 

In the Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex), you can read more about the different data types we've discussed. Don't let this comprehensive documentation scare you. Just try to read through it and see which parts you can already understand. The more advanced you get in Python, the more you'll encounter huge documentation pages where you have the find the bits of information you need to solve your problem. The sooner you learn how to do this, the better!

You are learning Python 3 in this course. When going through Python Documentation, make sure that you're reading about Python 3, and not Python 2! The differences are not big, but can be hard to spot and confusing to new users.
