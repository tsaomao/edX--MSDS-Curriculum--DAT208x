Further Readings for Chapter 1. Python Basics:
To learn more about Python's recent developments, you can visit www.python.org (https://www.python.org/); the official home page of the Python programming language. Here, you will find guidelines to get started with Python on your own system. 

In the Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex), you can read more about the different data types we've discussed. Don't let this comprehensive documentation scare you. Just try to read through it and see which parts you can already understand. The more advanced you get in Python, the more you'll encounter huge documentation pages where you have the find the bits of information you need to solve your problem. The sooner you learn how to do this, the better!

You are learning Python 3 in this course. When going through Python Documentation, make sure that you're reading about Python 3, and not Python 2! The differences are not big, but can be hard to spot and confusing to new users.

Further Readings for Chapter 2. List - A Data Structure:
To get a deeper insight into Python lists, you can check out the official documentation on Data Structures (https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/datastructures.html). If you don't understand everything in there (such as the append() method for example), don't worry: we'll get to that soon enough.

At the end of the third video, Filip pointed out the difference between copying the list contents, or a reference to the list. He pointed out that this was only a simplified version of the story. If you're interested in the bigger picture, you can go through this documentation page (https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/copy.html).
